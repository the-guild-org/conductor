### Create a configuration file

First, Conductor needs to know about your GraphQL server(s). You can do this by adding a new `Source` to Conductor. 

`Source` can either be a [`single GraphQL server`](./docs/configuration/sources/graphql) or a federated setup of multiple GraphQL servers.

```yaml {2-5} filename="conductor.config.yaml"
sources:
  - id: my-graphql-server # defines the ID of the source
    type: graphql # defines the type of the Source
    config:
      endpoint: https://my-server.com/graphql # points to the actual GraphQL endpoint
```

Then, you expose your `Source` by using an `Endpoint` object. Each endpoint is registered with it's own URL and can be configured to use a different `Source` and a different set of plugins:

```yaml /my-graphql-server/ {6-8} filename="conductor.config.yaml"
sources:
  - id: my-graphql-server # defines the ID of the source
    type: graphql # defines the type of the Source
    config:
      endpoint: https://my-server.com/graphql # points to the actual GraphQL endpoint
endpoints:
  - path: /my-amazing-graphql-server # defines the base path for this endpoint
    from: my-graphql-server # link this endpoint to a Source
```

Now, to enrich your GraphQL API with additional functionality, you can add plugins to your `Endpoint`. For example, you can add a `graphiql` plugin to enable the GraphiQL IDE for your GraphQL API, and `http_get` to allow executing GraphQL operations overt HTTP `GET` method:

```yaml {9-15} filename="conductor.config.yaml"
sources:
  - id: my-graphql-server # defines the ID of the source
    type: graphql # defines the type of the Source
    config:
      endpoint: https://my-server.com/graphql # points to the actual GraphQL endpoint
endpoints:
  - path: /my-amazing-graphql-server # defines the base path for this endpoint
    from: my-graphql-server # link this endpoint to a Source
    plugins:
      - type: graphiql
      - type: http_get
        config:
          mutations: false
```

### Pick your runtime

Conductor can run as a standalon service through a binary/Docker image, or as a WASM on CloudFlare Worker.

Pick your preferred runtime [and follow the instructions on how to load the configuration, deploy, and run Conductor](./configuration/general#loading-the-config-file).
